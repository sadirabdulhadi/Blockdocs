								<h3>MoSCoW</h3>
								<p>Because of the disruptive and challenging nature of our project, as well as the very general brief we got at the beginning of the year, our requirements took a lot of time to become clear. However, we believe they now describe the general behaviour of the software we want to build.</p>
									<h5 style="margin-top:4%;">Must have</h5>
										<li>Be able to upload a document (a hasht to it) to the blockchain</li>
										<li>
											Be able to somehow sign documents on the blockchain (with an abstraction of transactions for example)
										</li>
										<li>
											Be able to verify the signatures of the document
										</li>
										<li>
											User authentication with usernames and passwords
										</li>
									<h5 style="margin-top:4%;">Should have</h5>
										<li>
											Have two user interfaces: one for the regular users who want their documents authenticated, the other for institutions who have the power to legalise dosuments.
										</li>
										<li>
											Documents can be signed by more than one person
										</li>
										<li>
											Very smooth and easy navigation
										</li>
									<h5 style="margin-top:4%;">Could have</h5>
										<li>
											Open the API to a developer community, such that anyone who comes up with a future requirement could also have access to these documents (Open source project)
										</li>
										<li>
											Automatically implement a piece of code (e.g. release funds) once a document is legalised / signed
										</li>
									<h5 style="margin-top:4%;">Won't have</h5>
									<li>
										Only predetermined institutions can legalise documents (it's hard to verify their identity otherwise)
									</li>
								</br>

								<h3>Personas</h3>

								<h3>Scenarios</h3>
									<p>One of the scenarios we wrote is the following: </p>
									<p>
										1-Nadine has a scholarship at UCL and receives funds from the Jordanian government. She needs to authenticate her student of statement status by asking UCL to sign the paper. However, the process is not that simple and she has to go through many steps before receiving any funds. It is expensive and takes too long. </br>
										2-However, Nadine has an idea. She decides to use BlockDocs to make the process quicker and easier. </br>
										3-She uploads her student of statement status to the website and sends a signature request to UCL. </br>
										4-After UCL signs the document she can send it to the Jordanian government that can be sure that the document is authentic.</p>
									
								<h3>Sketches and Storyboard</h3>

								<h3>Use Cases</h3>
								<img src="images/usercases.pdf" style="width:90%;">
								<h3>Prototype</h3>
								<p>While considering alternatives for the developer platforms we felt that mobile applications are not very often trusted for operations dealing with confidential documents. Hence, we decided to build a web app. </p>
								<p><b>The regular user portal</b></p>
