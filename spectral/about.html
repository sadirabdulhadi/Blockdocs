								<h3>What is the problem?</h3>
								<p>Notarising and legalising documents can be tedious. Very often, documents that are issued in a country and are required to be used in another one require to pass through a long chain of stamps and signatures, including those of a Notary Public, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the respective embassy.</p>

								<p>Here's the process:
								<li>The notary public verifies the authenticity of the document by contacting the issuing authority.</li>
								<li>To make the "internal stamp" an internationally recognised one, the document has to be signed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</li>
								<li>To make the "international stamp" an "internal" one again, this time in the country it's intended to be used, the embassy of this country must sign this document.</li>
								</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>What is our solution?</h4>
								<p>We can establish an analogy between verifying the authenticity of the document, and verifying the value of money. If the blockchain can help in solving the second problem with the Blockchain, then it can also eventually help in fixing the first one.</p>

								<p>
									Hence our idea consists in building a platform which allows you to:
									<li>Upload a reference of a document to the blockchain</li>
									<li>Sign the reference</li>
									<li>Explore the signatures on a specific document (while protecting privacy)</li>

								</p>
								<p>
									In fact, we aim to have the document (or a reference to it) uploaded to the blockchain, with relevant signatures.

								<p>Hi I'm Kristelle, I am a second year student at UCL studying Computer Science. This project was all new to me and I did not know what to expect before we started. I find the subject very interesting and the possibilities blockchain offers are impressive. I am glad to be working on it with my team.   </p>
